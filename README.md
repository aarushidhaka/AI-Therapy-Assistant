# AI-Therapy-Assistant
This project develops an AI-powered therapy assistant to detect academic stress and provide empathetic support to university students. Leveraging advanced NLP techniques like DistilBERT fine-tuning, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and prompt engineering, the system classifies emotions and risk levels while adhering to clinical safety protocols.

# ü§ñ AI Therapy Assistant ‚Äì Generative AI Project

This project develops an **AI-powered therapy assistant** to detect academic stress and provide empathetic support to university students. Leveraging advanced NLP techniques like **DistilBERT fine-tuning**, **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**, and **prompt engineering**, the system classifies emotions and risk levels while adhering to clinical safety protocols.  

It includes **human-in-the-loop mechanisms** and Warwick-specific wellbeing resources to ensure responsible deployment in academic environments.

## üìä Project Overview

- **Objective**: Build an AI system to classify academic stress, detect high-risk scenarios, and generate supportive responses.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Fine-tuned **DistilBERT** for emotion and risk classification (79% accuracy).  
  - Designed 12 emotion-specific prompts for **FLAN-T5** to deliver dynamic, empathetic replies.  
  - Reduced GPU memory usage by **40%** via **LoRA** without compromising performance.  
  - Embedded safety measures like regex filters, response constraints, and clinician override.
